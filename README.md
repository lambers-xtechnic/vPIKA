# vPIKA v1.4
A cutting-edge radiation sensor capable of distinguishing between X-rays and gamma rays，
The sensor is currently in production testing, and it can output multiple types of signals. 
The output is TTL pulse signals. If you have the capability, we hope you can develop algorithm programs suitable for this sensor.
Of course, I will provide the basic recognition program for the sensor here.
The sensor has been developed into two main categories: one with an ultra-compact size, and the other with a larger form factor but 
capable of measuring radiation energy spectra. We welcome everyone to discuss this, and I will update the latest program materials 
on my website and here.
